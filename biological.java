Get expert advice if there are signs of structural defects.\nAnchor overhead lighting fixtures to the ceiling.\nFollow BIS codes relevant to your area for building standards\nFasten shelves securely to walls.\nPlace large or heavy objects on lower shelves.\nStore breakable items such as bottled foods, glass, and china in low, closed cabinets with latches.\nHave a disaster emergency kit ready\n\nBattery operated torch with extra batteries\nBattery operated radio\nFirst aid kit and manual\nEmergency food (dry items) and water (packed and sealed)\nCandles and matches in a waterproof container\nKnife\nChlorine tablets or powdered water purifiers\nDevelop an emergency communication plan\n\n \n\nIn case family members are separated from one another during an earthquake (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), develop a plan for reuniting after the disaster.\nAsk an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the 'family contact' after the disaster; it is often easier to call long distance. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person.\nHelp your community get ready\n\nPublish a special section in your local newspaper with emergency information on earthquakes. Localize the information by printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices and hospitals.\nConduct week-long series on locating hazards in the home.\nWork with local emergency services and officials to prepare special reports for people with mobility impairment on what to do during an earthquake.\nWhat to Do During an Earthquake\n\nStay as safe as possible during an earthquake. Be aware that some earthquakes are actually foreshocks and a larger earthquake might occur. Minimize your movements to a few steps that reach a nearby safe place and stay indoors until the shaking has stopped and you are sure exiting is safe.\n\nIf indoors\n\nDROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. If there is no a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.\nProtect yourself by staying under the lintel of an inner door, in the corner of a room, under a table or even under a bed.\nStay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, (such as lighting fixtures or furniture).\nIf outdoors\n\nDo not move from where you are. However, move away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires.\nIf you are in open space, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings; at exits; and alongside exterior walls. Most earthquake-related casualties result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects.\nIf in a moving vehicle\n\nStop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.\nProceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake.\nIf trapped under debris\n\nDo not light a match.\nDo not move about or kick up dust.\nCover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.");
