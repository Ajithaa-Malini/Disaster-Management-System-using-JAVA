Get expert advice if there are signs of structural defects.\nAnchor overhead lighting fixtures to the ceiling.\nFollow BIS codes relevant to your area for building standards\nFasten shelves securely to walls.\nPlace large or heavy objects on lower shelves.\nStore breakable items such as bottled foods, glass, and china in low, closed cabinets with latches.\nHave a disaster emergency kit ready\n\nBattery operated torch with extra batteries\nBattery operated radio\nFirst aid kit and manual\nEmergency food (dry items) and water (packed and sealed)\nCandles and matches in a waterproof container\nKnife\nChlorine tablets or powdered water purifiers\nDevelop an emergency communication plan\n\n \n\nIn case family members are separated from one another during an earthquake (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), develop a plan for reuniting after the disaster.\nAsk an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the 'family contact' after the disaster; it is often easier to call long distance. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person.\nHelp your community get ready\n\nPublish a special section in your local newspaper with emergency information on earthquakes. Localize the information by printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices and hospitals.\nConduct week-long series on locating hazards in the home.\nWork with local emergency services and officials to prepare special reports for people with mobility impairment on what to do during an earthquake.\nWhat to Do During an Earthquake\n\nStay as safe as possible during an earthquake. Be aware that some earthquakes are actually foreshocks and a larger earthquake might occur. Minimize your movements to a few steps that reach a nearby safe place and stay indoors until the shaking has stopped and you are sure exiting is safe.\n\nIf indoors\n\nDROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. If there is no a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.\nProtect yourself by staying under the lintel of an inner door, in the corner of a room, under a table or even under a bed.\nStay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, (such as lighting fixtures or furniture).\nIf outdoors\n\nDo not move from where you are. However, move away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires.\nIf you are in open space, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings; at exits; and alongside exterior walls. Most earthquake-related casualties result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects.\nIf in a moving vehicle\n\nStop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.\nProceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake.\nIf trapped under debris\n\nDo not light a match.\nDo not move about or kick up dust.\nCover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.");

Ask the Insurance Agent about the benefits from Multi-Hazard Insurance Schemes.\n\t* Discuss tsunamis with your family.Everyone should know what to do in a tsunami situation. Discussing tsunamis ahead of time will help reduce fear and save precious time in an emergency. Review flood safety and preparedness measures with your family.\n\nIf you are in an area at risk from tsunamis\n\n\t* You should find out if your home, school, workplace, or other frequently visited locations are in tsunami hazard areas.\n\t* Know the height of your street above sea level and the distance of your street from the coast or other high-risk waters.\n\t* Also find out the height above sea level and the distance from the coast of outbuildings that house animals, as well as pastures or corrals.\n\t* Plan evacuation routes from your home, school, workplace, or any other place you could be where tsunamis present a risk.\n\t* If possible, pick areas (30 meters) above sea level or go as far as 3 kilometres inland, away from the coastline.\n\t* If you cannot get this high or far, go as high or far as you can. Every meter inland or upward may make a difference. You should be able to reach your safe location on foot within 15 minutes. After a disaster, roads may become blocked or unusable. Be prepared to evacuate by foot if necessary. Footpaths normally lead uphill and inland, while many roads parallel coastlines. Follow posted tsunami evacuation routes; these will lead to safety. Local emergency management officials can advise you on the best route to safety and likely shelter locations.\n\t* If your children's school is in an identified inundation zone, find out what the school evacuation plan is. Find out if the plan requires you to pick your children up from school or from another location. Telephone lines during a tsunami watch or warning may be overloaded and routes to and from schools may be jammed.\n\t* Practice your evacuation routes. Familiarity may save your life. Be able to follow your escape route at night and during inclement weather. Practicing your plan makes the appropriate response more of a reaction, requiring less thinking during an actual emergency situation.\n\t* Use a Weather Radio or stay tuned to a local radio or television station to keep informed of local watches and warnings.\n\t * Talk to your insurance agent.Homeowners' policies may not cover flooding from a tsunami. Ask the Insurance Agent about the benefits from Multi-Hazard Insurance Schemes.\n\t* Discuss tsunamis with your family. Everyone should know what to do in a tsunami situation. Discussing tsunamis ahead of time will help reduce fear and save precious time in an emergency. Review flood safety and preparedness measures with your family.\n \n\nIf you are visiting an area at risk from tsunamis\n\n\tCheck with the hotel or campground operators for tsunami evacuation information and find out what the warning system is for tsunamis. It is important to know designated escape routes before a warning is issued.\n\tOne of the early warning signals of a tsunami is that the sea water recedes several metres, exposing fish on shallow waters or on the beaches. If you see the sea water receding, you must immediately leave the beach and go to higher ground far away from the beach.\n\tProtect Your Property\n\tYou should avoid building or living in buildings within 200 meters of the high tide coastline.\n\tThese areas are more likely to experience damage from tsunamis, strong winds, or coastal storms.\n\tMake a list of items to bring inside in the event of a tsunami.\n\tA list will help you remember anything that can be swept away by tsunami water.\n\tElevate coastal homes.\n\tMost tsunami waves are less than 3 meters. Elevating your house will help reduce damage to your property from most tsunamis.\n\tTake precautions to prevent flooding.\n\tHave an engineer check your home and advise about ways to make it more resistant to tsunami water.\n\tThere may be ways to divert waves away from your property. Improperly built walls could make your situation worse. Consult with a professional for advice.\n\tEnsure that any outbuildings, pastures, or corrals are protected in the same way as your home. When installing or changing fence lines, consider placing them in such a way that your animals are able to move to higher ground in the event of a tsunami.\n ");
