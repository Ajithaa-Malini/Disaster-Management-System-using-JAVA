However, move away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires.\nIf you are in open space, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings; at exits; and alongside exterior walls. Most earthquake-related casualties result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects.\nIf in a moving vehicle\n\nStop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.\nProceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake.\nIf trapped under debris\n\nDo not light a match.\nDo not move about or kick up dust.\nCover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.");
